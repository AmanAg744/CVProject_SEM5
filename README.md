# Ultrasound Image Reconstruction: A comparative study

## Overview
This project focuses on reconstructing ultrasound images from low to high quality. It aims to enhance image clarity, improving the accuracy and utility of medical ultrasound scans. Leveraging advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, the project enhances resolution and reduces noise in ultrasound images, facilitating more accurate diagnoses.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Steps for noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and normalization.
- **Image Reconstruction**: Techniques for upscaling and resolution enhancement.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing image quality improvements using PSNR, SSIM, etc.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AmanAg744/CVProject_SEM5.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
- Run `main.ipynb` to execute the image reconstruction pipeline.
- Adjust parameters in the notebook as per requirements.

## Results
Sample results of low-to-high-quality reconstruction can be reviewed using the [Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset).
