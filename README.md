# Ultrasound Image Reconstruction: A comparative study

## ðŸ”¬ Project Overview
Enhance the clarity and diagnostic value of medical ultrasound scans through advanced image reconstruction techniques. This project leverages cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning algorithms to transform low-quality ultrasound images into high-resolution, noise-reduced versions, potentially improving medical diagnoses and patient outcomes.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Sophisticated Preprocessing**: Implement noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and normalization techniques
- **Advanced Reconstruction**: Apply state-of-the-art upscaling and resolution enhancement methods
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Utilize industry-standard metrics like PSNR and SSIM to quantify improvements
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook**: Easily adjust parameters and visualize results

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AmanAg744/CVProject_SEM5.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ðŸ’» Usage

1. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions to preprocess and reconstruct ultrasound images
3. Experiment with different parameters to optimize results
4. Visualize and compare the original and enhanced images

## ðŸ“Š Results
